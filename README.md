# Mitchell-EDI-Invoices
EDI 880 invoices are very precise and require very close attention to detail. The format PDF provided explains exactly how these invoices are formatted. However, once you have the raw data, there are potentially thousands of unique codes that are used throughout the invoices that need to be translated. Those codes can be found here https://www.kasoftware.com/schema/edi/x12/00401/messages/880/ and are programmed for utilization in the file edi_codes.py. Those translations are also added to the data next to the code allowing analysts and management to be able to more easily understand the data and have a better conversation. Converting this unstructured data into structured data is critical in making better business decisions, and this case is especially unique as trying to read an invoice at face value is very challenging.
